# GNR638-Project
**Team Members:**<br />
Soutrik Sarangi, Mrunal Lalwali, Amit Kumar, Sahil Khan<br />
**Paper Implemented**<br />
https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004(Pix2Pix GAN for image to image translation)
**Required modules and frameworks**<br />
This project is implemented using PyTorch framework. Various other modules such as numpy, matplotlib etc have also been used for the same<br />
**Experiments performed**<br />
Comparing values of lambda_L1, receptive field of discriminator, use in segmentation
**How to run the code**<br />
1. Code has been written in .ipynb notebook. It is modular. First the classes defining the artitecture needs to be run.<br />
2. Then one needs to run the data loading and processing pipeline<br />
3. Finally, the testing and training classes has to be run<br />
